## Introduction

The Smart Budget Analyzer is designed to analyze financial transactions, providing insights into spending patterns, forecasting future trends, and detecting anomalies. With a focus on advanced OOP principles, this project employs design patterns such as Strategy, Observer, and Factory to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. Defensive programming practices and robust logging are used throughout to ensure data integrity and fault tolerance.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:**  
  Load financial transactions from CSV files with rigorous validation and error handling.

- **Domain Model:**  
  Clean transaction hierarchy with Credit and Debit transactions, including encapsulation and input validation.

- **Advanced Analysis Strategies:**  
  - **Trend Analysis:** Summarize total credits, debits, and net balance.
  - **Clustering Analysis:** Aggregate expenses by category.
  - **Forecast Analysis:** Predict future amounts using linear regression (via NumPy).
  - **Anomaly Detection:** Identify outliers using statistical methods.

- **Design Patterns:**  
  - **Strategy Pattern:** Easily switch between different analysis algorithms.
  - **Observer Pattern:** Notify observers when analyses are complete.
  - **Factory Pattern:** Centralized creation of transaction objects.

- **Transaction Management:**  
  Sorting, filtering, and summarizing transactions with a dedicated Transaction Manager.

- **Reporting & Visualization:**  
  Aesthetic, formatted reports and text-based visual summaries that are both clear and informative.

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  Extensive logging, input validation, and error handling to ensure robust execution.


## Getting Started
