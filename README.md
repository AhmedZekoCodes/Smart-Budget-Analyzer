# 💰 Budget Analysis & Reporting System

This project implements the backend for a modular and extensible budget analysis app written in Python. The system is designed to process financial data from various sources, compute categorized expenses, and generate insightful reports for improved financial awareness.

Developed as an exercise to implement my knowledge on clean architecture, software design patterns, and domain-driven development.

## 📌 Project Description

This system allows for tracking and analyzing budget data using a separation-of-concerns approach. The architecture emphasizes maintainability and testability, making it a strong foundation for future extensions like web dashboards and applications, database integration, or real-time financial tracking.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Modular Domain Layer**: Clearly defines data models and core business logic.
- **Interface-Driven Design**: Interfaces for data sources and observers promote flexibility and decoupling.
- **Extensible Reporting**: Easily customizable reporting layer to display analytics.
- **Observer Pattern**: Automatically triggers updates when new budget entries are added.

## 🧠 Technical Overview

- **Language**: Python
- **Design Patterns**:
  - Observer Pattern (for change notifications)
  - Strategy-like interface definitions for extensibility
- **Architecture**:
  - `budget_domain.py`: Defines the `BudgetItem` and `BudgetCategory` classes.
  - `budget_datasource.py`: Sample data generation for test cases or real usage.
  - `budget_observer.py`: Implements observers that listen to changes in budget state.
  - `budget_reporting.py`: Contains functions for generating summary reports.
  - `budget_interfaces.py`: Interfaces for observers and data providers.
  - `budget_analysis.py`: Main analysis controller and entry point.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the analysis:

```bash
python budget_analysis.py
```

The program reads sample data, performs the analysis, and prints a categorized budget report to the console.

## 📂 File Breakdown

- `budget_analysis.py`: Main script to run the budget tracking system.
- `budget_domain.py`: Core logic for managing categories and transactions.
- `budget_datasource.py`: Mock data generator for simulating budget input.
- `budget_observer.py`: Observer implementations for reactive updates.
- `budget_interfaces.py`: Interface contracts used across the project.
- `budget_reporting.py`: Functions to generate and print the financial summary.
